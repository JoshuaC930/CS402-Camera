# Assignment 4 - Camera
## Written By: Joshua Corrales - CS402 Fall 2023

# Overview

This is a simple Camera application that allows the user to take pictures and saves that to a list. The images in this list can be saved to the local device, shared through the device's native share function or deleted. 

# Usage
You can run the application using `expo-cli` for testing. Firstly, you will need run the following commands
```
npm install
install -g expo
npx expo start
```
From there you can use the provided QR code and the ExpoGo app to run the application on your local device.

# Reflection

This project was pretty fun to do. It wasn't as difficult as the previous assignment however it was still quite the challenge to get setup as this time, I was not working with text items, but rather image objects. So it was a little bit of a challenge to get set up, but it was fun to figure out non-the-less. Also, to make development a little easier, a lot of my testing was done through Google's Android Studio via the Android Emulator, however I did switch to my phone and everything seemed to work fine.
